		<h1>Hi, I'm Jimmy</h1>
<p>I've always been interested in the design and craft of all the things we make as a species, from being a child and wanting to understand how things work ‘under the hood’, to studying the alphabet and typography at university, I’ve always had a lot of curiosity surrounding how we can make our tools better, easier to use, more efficient and robust.</p>
<p>The driving force behind my curiosity is that I’m a determined problem solver, and a broad understanding of the world and its workings only helps me to make my solutions more varied and useful.</p>
<p>The most important tool we use collectively today is without doubt the internet. It's as important as the alphabet and printing-press as a way of communicating and sharing ideas. I’d like a better understanding of how it works, as well as how I can use and develop it further.</p>
<p>For the past few years I have worked in running bike shops or helping small cycle businesses grow, I am also chairman of a bicycle sporting association. My drive for efficiency and finding powerful solutions for problems has often brought me into contact with programming, whether it was excel spreadsheets, or online forms, I have had to self-study to make my systems better and find myself wanting for more.</p>
<p>Whilst in the cycle industry I have learnt a lot about organisation, communication and people management, but it’s time for me to close the chapter on working in this industry and to focus on riding for leisure and opening a new chapter of working life with the web. I hope that journey starts here.</p>
